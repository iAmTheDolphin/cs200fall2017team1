        The Use Cases and their corresponding diagrams and scenarios were split amongst four members.
        <br/> The fifth member was responsible for creating the main HTML report and assisting in Use Case design.
        <br/>
        <br/> I (Parker) was responsible for building the HTML file used in our report, and for gathering all Use Case
        diagrams and designs.
        <br/> I also helped other team members solve problems or complications with their Use Case scenarios.
        <br/> As the team's submitter, I was also responsible for submitting our completed project and full solution.
        <br/>
        <br/> The task distribution for each group member was even and is outlined below. Each individual's report is also linked.

        written to its own file, and the name of the file should begin with the member name, followed by the date of the
