    <p>

        <br/> I (Parker) was responsible for the Coupling and Cohesion Paragraph and for building the HTML file used for our report.
        <br/>
        <br/> As the team's submitter, I was also responsible for submitting our completed project and full solution.
        <br/>
        <br/> The task distribution for each group member was even and is outlined below. Each individual's report.html is linked next to their name:
        <br/> Parker Jones - 20%
        <br/> Hunter James - 20%
        <a href="Reports/HunterJames_team1.html"> HunterJames_team1.html</a>
        <br/> Aislinn Marsden - 20%
        <a href="Reports/aislinnmarsden_team1.html"> aislinnmarsden_team1.html</a>
        <br/> Riley Manning - 20%
        <a href="Reports/rileymanning_team1.html"> rileymanning_team1.html</a>

    <p>The Provider Interface class manages methods and operations that the provider
        <br/>can access from their terminal as well as attributes that store whether if
        <br/>they are validated and what their ID is. Service Record class allows the
        <br/>creation of objects and store all the data for a service record. Database
        <br/>controller is a class that stores the users, service codes, and service records.
        <br/>Database Controller also provides methods to add, remove, and search from datasets.
        <br/>The Report class and its subclasses encapsulate relevant data into an object.
        <br/>User and its subclasses encapsulate the data for the users and allow the management
        <br/>of members and providers.  The software classes are formed according to function,
        <br/>such as storing and managing data, and handling the providers information and
        <br/>operations. The classes couple to perform operations on each others datasets.
        <br/>By using this design, we achieve low coupling and high cohesion with out project.
