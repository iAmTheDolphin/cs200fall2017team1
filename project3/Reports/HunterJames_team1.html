<p>
    After one of our team members dropped the course, each remaining team member took on extra work. I (Hunter) was responsible for Interactive Mode: I completed the section of the class diagram relating to the Managing Members and Providers and created the sequence diagram for the Manage Members and Providers use cases.
    <br/>
    <br/> The task distribution for each group member was even and is outlined below:
    <br/> Hunter James - 25%
    <br/> Parker Jones - 25%
    <br/> Aislinn Marsden - 25%
    <br/> Riley Manning - 25%
