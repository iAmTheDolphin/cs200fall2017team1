<h2>Task Distribution:</h2>

<p>Our team lost a member so now there are only four of us, but we were able to split the project evenly.
    <br/>Hunter, Riley, and I focused on the sequence diagrams and the class diagram.
    <br/>Parker focused on the HTML report and the paragraph. Everyone reviewed everyone else's work as the requirements were completed.
    <br/>We all ended up working for about eight to nine hours each on this project, with relatively equal workloads.
