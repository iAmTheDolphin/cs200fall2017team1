<h2>Task Distribution:</h2>

<p>With this project, we decided to split the tasks into smaller groups or individual projects.
    <br/>Everyone created activity diagrams for the use cases they created, and reviewed everyone else's to make sure they all matched up.
    <br/>Cole and I focused on the overall activity diagram, Parker and Riley focused on the paragraph and stereotype class diagram, and
    Hunter focused on the HTML as well as generally helping with the project.
    <br/>We all ended up working for about ten to eleven hours each on this project, with relatively equal workloads.
