<h2>Task Distribution:</h2>

<p>The Use Cases and their corresponding diagrams and scenarios were split amongst four members.
    <br/>The fifth member (Parker) did the HTML report and helped with use case design.
    <br/>
    <br/>I was responsible for the use case scenario for the process of requesting a provider directory.
    <br/>I also put together the overall use case diagram.
    <br/>
    <br/> The task distribution for each group member was even and is outlined below:
    <br/> Hunter James - 20%
    <br/> Parker Jones - 20%
    <br/> Cole Schram - 20%
    <br/> Aislinn Marsden - 20%
    <br/> Riley Manning - 20%
