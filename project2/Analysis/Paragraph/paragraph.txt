The database of providers and members for identification , the main accounting procedure, the creation and sending of reports, the logging and billing of services, and the maintenance of the provider and member history will be computerized. Corresponding data will be stored on hard drives in ChocAn's central servers. Necessary hardware will include servers and hard drives to store the data. The ChocAn system will interact with other systems to send accounting information to ACME Accounting and send provider reports to providers. Providers and members will interact with our system through terminals placed at the provider's business. ChocAn employees can interact with the ChocAn servers directly by connecting to the server.
