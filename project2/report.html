    <h2>Task Distribution:</h2>
    <p>
        The Activity Diagrams were assigned to three team members, each of whom had been responsible for certain Use Cases in Project 1.
        <br/> The fourth and fifth members were responsible for creating the stereotype class diagram and writing the system analysis paragraph.
        <br/>
        <br/> I (Hunter) was responsible for the Interactive Mode activity diagrams (8 total) and for building the HTML file used for our report.
        <br/>
        <br/> As the team's submitter, I was also responsible for submitting our completed project and full solution.
        <br/>
        <br/> The task distribution for each group member was even and is outlined below:
        <br/> Hunter James - 20%
        <br/> Parker Jones - 20%
        <br/> Cole Schram - 20%
        <br/> Aislinn Marsden - 20%
        <br/> Riley Manning - 20%

    <p>
        The sections of the system that will be computerized will be the database of providers and members for identification, the main accounting procedure, the creation and sending of reports, the logging and billing for services, and the maintenance of the provider and member history. Data for all this will be stored on hard drives in the central servers for ChocAn. Necessary hardware will be the servers and hard drives to store the data. The ChocAn system will interact with other systems to send accounting information to ACME Accounting and send provider reports to providers. Providers and members will interact with our system through terminals placed at the provider's business and employees of ChocAn can interact with theChocAn servers directly by connecting to the server to produce reports, generate records, and add or remove members and providers.

        Chocoholics Anonymous, which includes the following: data from provider’s terminal must be simulated by keyboard
        input, and data to be transmitted to a provider’s terminal must appear on the screen; each member report must be
        written to its own file, and the name of the file should begin with the member name, followed by the date of the
        report (the provider reports should be handled in the same way); the Provider Directory must also be created as

        <br/><a id="Update Member Records"/><b>Use Case:</b> Update Member Records
        <br/><b>Context:</b> Throughout the day, Operators must update member records to match any changes in membership
        <br/><b>Actors:</b> Operator, Member, Provider, Member Records Database
        <br/><b>Main Success Scenario:</b>
        <br/>1. The Operator receives notification that someone’s membership has changed.
        <br/>2. The Operator locates the Member’s individual record using their Member number.
        <br/>3. The Operator opens the Member’s file and makes the necessary changes.
        <br/>3.1. For simple changes (like address or phone number), the Operator simply edits the Member’s file and
        updates the information.
        <br/>3.2. For Provider visit updates, the Operator locates the form filled out by the Provider after the visit
        and adds the visit to the Member’s record.
        <br/>3.3. For billing updates, see Main Accounting Procedure.
        <br/>4. The Operator saves all changes and closes the Member’s record.
        <br/>
        <br/><b>Extensions:</b>
        <br/>1.1a. A new Member has joined and must be added to the system.
        <br/>1.2a. A member has resigned and must be removed from the system.
        <br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <br/><a id="Add New Member"/><b>Use Case:</b> Add New Member <b>extends</b> Update Member Records
        <br/><b>Context:</b> A new person registered for a ChocAn membership and must be added to the system.
        <br/><b>Actors:</b> Operator, Member, Member Records Database (part of ChocAn Data Center software)
        <br/><b>Main Success Scenario:</b>
        <br/>1.1.1. The new Member fills out the registration form (either online or in person)
        <br/>1.1.1.1. If in-person, the Data Center Operator manually retrieves this information
        <br/>1.1.1.2. If online, the form data is sent to the Operator.
        <br/>1.1.1.3. Form includes Member name, mailing address and phone number
        <br/>1.1.2. The Operator assigns the next available Member number to the new Member
        <br/>1.1.2.1. The Operator opens the document containing all Member numbers
        <br/>1.1.2.2. The Operator finds the most recently assigned number and adds 1.
        <br/>1.1.2.3. The new Member’s name is assigned to this number
        <br/>1.1.3. The Operator updates the ChocAn Data Center’s member records
        <br/>1.1.3.1. The Operator opens the member database and creates a new record
        <br/>1.1.3.2. The Member’s name, mailing address, phone number, and Member number are added to this unique
        member record
        <br/>1.1.4. The Member is sent a personalized card with their name and Member number
        <br/>1.1.4.1. If the Member filled out the registration form in person, an Operator prints out the card and
        gives it to the Member
        <br/>1.1.4.2. If the Member filled out the registration form online, an Operator prints out the card and mails
        it to the Member at their listed mailing address
        <br/>1.1.5. The Member is now ready to receive ChocAn services.
        <br/>
        <br/><b>Extensions:</b>
        <br/>1.1.1.3a. The Member name on the registration form matches an existing record
        <br/>1.1.1.3a.1. If the new Member is actually an existing member, the Operator does not make a new record for
        this Member.
        <br/>1.1.1.3a.2. If the new Member has the same name as an existing member, the process does not change. They
        will be distinguished from any similar names by their Member number.
        <br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <br/><a id="Delete Member"/><b>Use Case:</b> Delete Member <b>extends</b> Update Member Records
        <br/><b>Context:</b> A Member is no longer a part of ChocAn, and their record must be deleted.
        <br/><b>Actors:</b> Operator, Member, Member Records Database (part of ChocAn Data Center software)
        <br/><b>Main Success Scenario:</b>
        <br/>1.2.1. ChocAn is notified that a Member is to be removed from ChocAn.
        <br/>1.2.1.1. If the Member is choosing to be removed, they request this either in person, on the phone or in an
        email to a ChocAn Provider or Operator.
        <br/>1.2.1.2. If the Member must be removed for financial reasons, an Operator is notified by the ChocAn Data
        Center Manager.
        <br/>1.2.2. The Operator opens the Member records database in the ChocAn Data Center software.
        <br/>1.2.3. The Operator locates the Member’s individual record using their Member number.
        <br/>1.2.4. The Member’s record is deleted by the Operator.
