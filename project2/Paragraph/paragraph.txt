The sections of the system that will be computerized will be the database of providers and members for identification , the main accounting procedure, the creation and sending of reports, the logging and billing for services, and the maintenance of the provider and member history. Data for all this will be stored on hard drives in the central servers for ChocAn. Necessary hardware will be the servers and hard drives to store the data. The ChocAn system will interact with other systems to send accounting information to ACME Accounting and send provider reports to providers. Providers and members will interact with our system through terminals placed at the provider's business and employees of ChocAn can interact with theChocAn servers directly by connecting to the server to produce reports, generate records, and add or remove members and providers.
