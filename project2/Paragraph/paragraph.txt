The sections of the system that will be computerized will be the database of providers and members for identification , the main accounting procedure, the creation and sending of reports, the logging and billing for services, and the maintenance of the provider and member history. The Necessary data for all this will be stored on Hard Disk Drives in the central servers for ChocAn. Necessary hardware will be computers to be the servers themselves as well as multiple Hard Drives to store the data multiple times to ensure there is a backup in the event of a failure. The ChocAn system will interact with other systems over an internet connection. These interactions will be things like sending accounting information to ACME Accounting and sending provider reports to providers. End users such as providers and members will interact with our system through terminals placed at the providers place of business and employees of ChocAn can interact with the central ChocAn server directly by connecting to the server from their computers to produce reports, generate records, and add or remove members and providers.
