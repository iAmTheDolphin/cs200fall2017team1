<h2>Task Distribution:</h2>

<p>Four members (Riley, Hunter, Cole, and I) focused on equal parts of the use case scenarios and diagrams.
    <br/>The fifth member (Parker) did the HTML report and helped with use case design.
    <br/>
    <br/>I personally did the use case scenarios for the process of billing ChocAn.
    This included use cases for: Validating the provider, giving a service to a member of ChocAn, and the actual billing process.
    <br/>The extensions dealt with invalid member credentials and what to do if a service did not have a code.
    <br/>
    <br/>As a team, we made sure the task distribution was equal between the five of us: each of us did 20% of the work.
