    <h2>Task Distribution:</h2>
    <p>
        The Use Cases and their corresponding diagrams and scenarios were split amongst four members.
        <br/> The fifth member was responsible for creating the main HTML report and assisting in Use Case design.
        <br/>
        <br/> I (Parker) was responsible for building the HTML file used in our report, and for gathering all Use Case
        diagrams and designs.
        <br/> I also helped other team members solve problems or complications with their Use Case scenarios.
        <br/> As the team's submitter, I was also responsible for submitting our completed project and full solution.
        <br/>
        <br/> The task distribution for each group member was even and is outlined below:
        <br/> Hunter James - 20%
        <br/> Parker Jones - 20%
        <br/> Cole Schram - 20%
