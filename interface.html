    Chocoholics Anonymous, which includes the following: data from provider’s terminal must be simulated by keyboard
    input, and data to be transmitted to a provider’s terminal must appear on the screen; each member report must be
    written to its own file, and the name of the file should begin with the member name, followed by the date of the
    report (the provider reports should be handled in the same way); the Provider Directory must also be created as a
    file, and none of the files should actually be sent as email attachments; for EFT data, a file is to be set up
    containing provider name, provider number and the amount to be transferred.
